# Job Ready Automation Test Engineer with JavaScript


## Javascript Basics

- Using VS Code Editor, and node JS as server I'm running my first script in this course module.

file name: helloworld.js
```javascript

console.log("\n'Hello world; I'm Arpit Dubey \
\n running my first script \
\n student of Job reeady Automation test engineer with java script course.'");
```
output :

![output helloworld.js](./images/1_helloworld.js)

- Now, in 2nd script I'm checking does change in value for same variable affect (or) does any impact on the output (or) not?
It will throw an exception (or) error (or) not?

```javascript
// let var const
let num = 10
console.log(`\nnum = ${num}`);

// try to assign different value to sam variable 'num' 
// let's see what it prints

num = 20
console.log(`\nnum = ${num}`);

```

output :
